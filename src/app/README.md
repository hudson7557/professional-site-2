For next time: 

    - The data models for the sections have mostly been set up, need components to utilize them though. 
    - Figure out the data structure for app data, was originally going to use a list of the various types 
    of data and then determine which component to make off of what data was present. However, that clashes 
    with what I currently know about the navbar. Look into how you can create nav link and add or subtract sections
    based upon what's present.
