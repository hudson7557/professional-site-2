# App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `/docs` directory to work with GitHub pages. 

## Deployment 

To deploy:

1. First build the app using `ng build`
2. Once the build is complete, the docs folder will have been recreated. 
3. Make sure to create a copy of [docs/index.html](docs/index.html) and rename it to 404.html per [GitHub pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en)
4. Ensure that the CNAME isn't being deleted (you'll see it being removed in the commit). If it is you'll have to reset the custom domain on github.
5. Commit and push your changes.
